# Note-Taker-Application

## Description

This project was completed for the Columbia Coding Bootcamp. The purpose of this project was to add back-end functionality to an e-commerce application. This allows users to make GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to a database of items being sold with information such as categories, product names, price, stock, and tags.

## Installation

Run "npm install" to install dependencies for this project, as well as running the schema.sql file and seeds/index.js file in your command terminal to create a database and fill it with data. I used Insomnia for requests.

## Usage

This project can be run on a localhost server through node.js if installed locally.

## Credits

I referenced previous projects and examples from the Columbia University Coding Bootcamp to assist in creating this page. ChatGPT helped me work through bugs that I was having. 

## Features

The application allows users to manage a database of items for sale using GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests. Information can be added, removed, or updated from the database to reflect changes in price, quantity, and more. The purpose of this application is to provide an organized way to manage products for sale.
